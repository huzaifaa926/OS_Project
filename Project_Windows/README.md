- Now, create a file path.txt paste the paths of DataSet and Log, as an example path.txt is already there for you :wink: (use \\ in path).
- Copy the path.txt file and paste it in to `Merge_Sort`, `Quick_Sort` and `Radix_Sort`.
- Compile and Run each program separately.
- Generated output will be in the `Log` folder.
